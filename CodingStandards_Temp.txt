Make sure the solution works if PCH are turned off and force #includes are also off

Only include necessary files in all #includes

Add file headers exlpaining what each file is used for and includes + #includes
Add function, class headers that explain the purpose and use of each function, class.

// TODO: Research and decide on coding standards.

One standard I am sticking to moving forward is struct member naming.
Use a s_Var for naming struct variables.
